# Ionic Time Tracker ⚛️⏲️

## Description 📓

This App is a small Project built for the Course `Desktop-Webapplikationen`

This specific Project was built with the [`Ionic Framework`](https://ionicframework.com/) and uses [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) to encrypt Data

## Getting Started 🚀

Version:

- npm - `v10.2.5`
- nodeJS - `v20.10.0`
- rustup - `v1.26.0`

To start the Project and build all the necessary stuff you need to install `npm`, `nodeJS` and `rustup`

install `rustup` from [here](https://rustup.rs/)
